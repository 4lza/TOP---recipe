<h2>Lamb Karahi will take you for a ride</h2>
<p>Why you may ask? The combinations of ingredients make a flavour that's hard to resist. It has a good amount of heat, while the sweet tomatoes, combined with the thick, rich, gravy-like sauce, is pretty moreish. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>15 g ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. cumin powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. coriander powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. turmeric</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>1 plum tomato, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>80 ml vegetable oil (reserve 2tbsp) </li>
    <li>600 g diced lamb</li>
    <li>4 cm piece ginger, skin removed</li>
    <li>1 whole bulb garlic, peeled</li>
    <li>400 ml water</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. dried fenugreek</li>
    <li>1 tsp. black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp. chilli flakes</li>
    <li>1 tsp. cumin powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp. coriander powder</li>
    <li>1 green chilli sliced lengthways</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tsp. black onion seeds</li>
    <li>1/2 Garam masala</li>
    <li>4 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>50 g fresh coriander, finely chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 375ml water in a large saucepan. Add all the curry base ingredients apart from the tomato and simmer covered for 45 minutes until the onions become very soft. Add the tomatoes and cook for a further 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and blend to a smooth consistency in a blender, or with a hand blender. Set this curry base aside until needed. </li>
    <li>Begin by braising your meat. In a food processor, blitz the garlic and ginger, adding a little water if needed to loosen and turn into a paste. </li>
    <li>In a karahi, or heavy bottomed pan, heat the oil over a medium heat. Add the lamb pieces and fry for 3-4minutes, until browned. Next add the garlic and ginger paste from the blend and cook for a further two minutes. </li>
    <li>Next add the fenugreek, black pepper, chilli flakes, cumin powder, coriander powder and green chilli, along with the water, and simmer for approximately 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender. Keep checking the water and top up if needed, by the end of cooking there should only be a small amount of water left.</li>
    <li>Remove lamb and set aside, and clean out pan. Return to a medium heat and add the reserved 2tbsp oil. Add diced onion and cook for 5-6minutes, or until lightly browned. Add onion seeds and garam masala and cook for a further two minutes.</li>
    <li>Next, add diced tomatoes and cook for 2-3minutes until the tomatoes have broken down a little. </li>
    <li>Finally, add the curry base and the lamb back to the pot and allow to simmer for 10-15minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the lamb. </li>
    <li>Garnish with chopped coriander and serve with rice, naan and mango chutney. </li>
